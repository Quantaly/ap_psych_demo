# ap_psych_demo

A demo of a memory experiment for my AP Psychology class.

Participants are presented with a string of characters, then a single character; they must then indicate whether or not the single character was part of the string.

We will have multiple experimental groups (indicated with a "group" query parameter):
- One group will be told the purpose is to test their memory
- One group will be told the purpose is to test their character recognition
- One group will be told the purpose is to test their reaction time
- One group will be told nothing about the purpose (the "control group")

Our results will be presented in class.
